Neat! - A Framework with neat things
================================
Neat! is a framework that will be built over time to contain many, many handy little infrastructure things to ease various tasks in .Net.

This includes things like 
* Consuming RESTful endpoints
* Wrappers for internal .Net framework components to abstract them for testing
* Aspects for use with IoC frameworks to add common, cross-cutting concerns to projects
* and so on.
